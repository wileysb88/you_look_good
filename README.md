*******************************************************

**Purpose:** Create a forum in which women can embrace all their perfections regardless of their own inner demons. Users can create profiles to upload images while they are getting ready and may have doubts about their potential outfits. This forum is centered around positivity and encouraging women to see their own beauty that the world sees yet may be invisible to themselves.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
- javascript
- jQuery
- Sinatra
- sqlite
- BCrypt
- Database work and Migrations


**Approach Taken:**

Using similar technologies to <a href="https://github.com/wileysb88/project_2">CHOMP</a> I wanted to amp up the topic surrounding this, as well as work on some back end work without the incomparable <a href="https://github.com/msturrus">Michael Sturrus </a>  helping rock the backend. I also really struggled with picture upload technology and wanted to work on perfecting that!

**Installation Instructions:**

COMING SOON!

**Unsolved Problems**

This project is a work in progress! Most things are unsolved problems - but isn't life?
